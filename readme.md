## [LikeMyCat](https://www.likemycat.com) - recreated with Lavarel 4

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/davidkey/likeMyCat_laravel) for LikeMyCat site. The master branch is deployed to our production VM nightly.

## Deployment instructions (mostly for our own benifit :))

First, see the excellent documentation for a Laravel 4 starter site [here](https://github.com/andrew13/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Starter-Site).

Our personal workflow
1.  git clone [this repository]
2.  Create app/config/production (or app/config/(dev|staging|etc)
3.  Copy app/config/database.php to app/config/production and make suitable edits
4.  from root likemycat_laravel directory: php artisan migrate
5.  php artisan db:seed
6.  ./deploy.sh (change chown :www-data ... piece if needed)
7.  After configuring webserver config appropriately, login as 'admin@admin.com'. 
	Note that image display won't really work correctly until at least 2 image uploads are made.
